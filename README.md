<h1>About</h1>
PE2 is a datapack project that has been in the works for a little over a year now, with the goal to bring a more RPG feeling to Minecraft's leveling system. The main point being that you never lose your levels or xp, even after you die, use an anvil, enchant your items, etc.

<h1>Install</h1>
Installation of the pack is super simple.
<p>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Grab the lastest version of the datapack.</li>
  <li>Drag it into your datapacks folder in your world save folder.</li>
  <li>Open your world.</li>
  <ol type="i">
    <li>If you are already in your world, type /reload</li>
  </ol>
</ol>

<h1>How to Use</h1>
The current version of the datapack has everything set up for you, all you need to now is go kill some mobs.

<h1>Planned Features</h1>
This pack is by no means complete, but it definitely gets the point across for how Minecraft should have done their system.

Some up-coming features are:
  - A menu to make personalizing the datapack settings a lot easier
  - Support for add-on datapacks; Addons would use PE2 as a root, allowing for some better customization.
  - Optimizations for multiplayer
  
<h1>Uninstall</h1>
Uninstalling the pack is super easy.
<p>
type the following command into the chat.
<pre>/function pe2:uninstall</pre>
(All the xp you collected while using the pack will be returned to you)
